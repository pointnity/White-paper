Block chain is in the original Bitcoin as a carrier to create a new kind of technology under, i t is a promising technology. For tracking the distribution of ownership of digitalassets. 	<br>
The technology is designed to allow a continuous process in a series of block trading agree that these transactions can be invoked in exchange for assets the function of the contract. <br>
These ledgers are distribut ed by the miners do not have specific permissions composition.<br>
For distributed computing, which seems to be a typical application of state machine replication.<br>
When copying the classical state machine, each command ( or operations) can  be invoked at any t ime and by any process applied to the state machine, the processing target block chain expression i s added to the data agree in the next block, and going to state copy the target machine.<br>
However, one of the main differences between the chain and the bloc k state machine replication relationship between the consecutive negotiation embodiment consistent.<br>
Block chain needs of each case of inconsistency is deleted ( about a subtle and before). More specifically, block, i t must be explicitly included in the f ina l piece of information pointing to the original connection to the block chain. <br>
This is a  typical use  of  a  hash function having  an elastic collision, when applied to the contents of one block, the block hash output.<br>
Identifying consensus instance number of the proposed decision block X  must  be  embedded  in the instance number. <br>
In view of this chain block is a block of new technological innovations set of computer technology, subvert the traditional Internet.<br>
Block chain development process:<br>
Block chain technology came into being in  the  earliest prototype of  Bitcoin project.<br>
As   a distributed computing network behind Bitcoin, there is no centralized management,Bitcoin network has been running steadily nearly eight years, to support a  huge  transaction.<br>
No serious f laws. <br>
Identifying descriptive l i terature f i rst block chain is a bit coins, electronic cash system is a point to point network by name ( Nakamoto) written, but i t is focused on the bits token system.<br>
In fact, there are chain block, which the chain block i s described as a historical record for bitcoin trading account, there is no clear definitions and concepts.<br>
More broadly, the block chain i s a decentralized recording technology. <br>
Nodes participating in the system may not belong to the same organization, do es not need to trust each other; data block chain is maintained by all nodes.<br>
Each node can be involved in maintaining the copy, and get a copy of the complete record.<br>
Compared with traditional accounting methods, i ts features include:<br>
Support the growth of the chain can add records, and records can not be tampered occurs;<br>
Decentralization, more focused, there is no centralized control, and can reach a consensus, as far as possible to achieve a fair distribution;<br>
Encryption mechanisms to ensure that the tra nsaction can not deny and undermine the protection of user information and record as much privacy. More importantly, the  contract  can be smart with combined transaction block chain, to provide a more f lexible functionality of the contract, i t already suppo rts simple script calculation. To perform more complex operations.<br>
This may be extended beyond the block chain has the meaning of pure  data recording points and actually has " pervasive computing".<br>

1.1blocks and even the value of:<br>
-----

A typical modern enterprise, the merchant by completing negotiations and execution of transactions in the course of the contract. <br>
Block chain adept at how to  manage contracts and ensure the smooth implementation of the contract. Characteristic block chain varies according to the type and application scenarios.<br>
In terms of technical characteristics, the block chains are typically considered:<br>
•distributed fault- tolerant: the network is very strong, one - third of the abnormal state of the fault- tolerant nodes.<br>
•Non- tampering: consistent data submitted is always there, can not be destroyed or modified.<br>
•Privacy: Password guarantee that unauthorized data access, but can not be resolved.<br>

1.2block chain challenges:<br>
----

The key technologies and challenges, from a technical point of view, the block chain involves a variety of f ields, including distribution, warehousing, cryptography, psychology, economics, game theory, network protocols and so on.<br>
•How to prevent transactions from being tampered?<br>
•How to prove the identity of the transferee?<br>
•How to protect the privacy of both parties?<br>
Password exactly is an effective means to solve these problems provides. <br>
Traditional solutions include hashing algorithm, encryption and decryption algorithms, digital certificates and signatures ( blind signat ure, the application of the block chain technology could stimulate further development of cryptography, including random number generation, the strength of the security, encryption and decryption performance, as well as new technologies such as quantum com puting, and so on, the RSA algorithm can not provide adequate security, which will depend on breakthrough mathematical sciences and the
further development of a new generation of computing technology appears.<br>

1.2.1Distributed Consensus<br>
---------

This is an old topic, the core is how  to  solve this change is  consistent on  the  network, is a well- recognized, and this information is confirmed.<br> Big difference between public anonymous scenes of this problem and those with rights management. <br>
In Bitcoin block chain, taking into account the worst case scenario in a public guarantee of anonymity.<br>
" Workload proven to work side 〃 to avoid malicious data corruption. Probabilistic model and to ensure that the last one is legitimate longest chain.<br>
In addition, there Possum disabled organization and Casper, secured by the equity.<br>
These algorithms are based on the economic interests of the game. Let malicious participants lost their economic interests, so as to  ensure the cooperation of  most  people. At the same t ime, i t must be confirm ed by generating a plurality of blocks and probability assurance.<br>
Blockchain broader support more consensus mechanism, including the classic Byzantine algorithm, which can solve the problem of  uncertainty.<br>
Issue of  consensus will be  of great academic value of research focus for a long t ime.<br>
The main indicators include fault- tolerant nodes and the convergence speed ratio.<br>
prisoner of war ( POW) and other algorithms allow more than half of the non - cooperation of the nodes and PBFT less than a third than the theory of non- cooperative node to ensure the stability of the network.<br>

1.2.2Performance<br>
----------

How to improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction confirmation delay.<br>
Currently, the open bit chain block credits can only support about 7 bits per block cred i ts average throughput.<br>
Secure transaction confirmation t ime is one hour.<br>
Just make sure charges are broadcast to the network and transaction services, there is a high probability that the transaction will eventually be packaged into blocks. <br>
Unlike convent ional distributed system, the processing performance of the chain block can not be simply extended by  increasing the number of  nodes. <br>
In  fact, depending on  the processing power of   a single node to a large extent.<br>
Hardware - assisted encryption and decryption  functions will  be the core element of node performance.<br>
Currently, Open Source block chain i tself has achieved a normal configuration at the platform level, a single client with hundreds of
transactions per second throughput, optimistic forecasts will soon break through thousands  of  t imes per  second baseline.<br>
But  there are still tens of  thousands per second peak there i s   a big gap in the existing securities trading system. In addition, from design and engineering platform deployment, there are some areas ca n be optimized.<br>

1.2.3Scalability<br>
-----

Common distributed system can expand the processing capacity of the entire system by adding nodes to block chain network system, the problem is not so simple.<br>
Each node in the network core must remain involved in maintaining a complete storage and intelligent processing contracts. <br>
Thus, the total storage capacity of the entire network and to calculate the respective nodes based on. <br>
Even i f the number of nodes in the network too much,probably because of the consistency of the process to reduce the latency performance of the entire network, especially in the public network, due to the large number of processing nodes problem of low quality will be more obvious.<br>
Some of the more immediate idea is  to relax the restrictions, each node must participate in the complete process ( but at least some of the nodes must be able to deal with the full collaboration of this idea already in use in ultra- extreme; the same t ime period, the core layer the process is as  low  as  possible. in franchising mode, high- performance core node can also be used as a proxy node and the access node weak node.<br>

1.2.4System Security<br>
-------

Existing encryption algorithm sophisticated design of block chains. However, to ensure that they are safe? There is no abs olute security systems in the world.<br>
The system is designed by the people, by the people business. There are several aspects are difficult to escape.<br>
The f i rst is legislation. This is how blockchain system management? Attacked block chain system is crime?<br>
There are consequences for the banking system to attack. <br>
But some block chain or i ts implementation is not protected by law.<br>
Secondly, potential vulnerabilities in software implementation is inevitable.<br>
Taking into account the Open SSL, i t has been in use f or decades, still has such a low level of vulnerability.<br>
For the f inancial system, even a small f law could cause incalculable damage, both the client and the platform side.<br>

In addition, all records in the block chain transaction is publicly visible. Is Bi g Data people began to get excited when they hear me? Indeed, there are a lot of things can be analyzed here, they are big enough, have enough influence. In fact, i t has been recorded.<br>
In addition, as a fully distributed system, the lack of effective publi c block chain adjustment mechanism, once i t works loopholes, i t is difficult to solve the problem, so to make i t more equitable and better.<br>
In addition, the block may be varied chain running application intelligence contract, there must be a method for safe control, and before the registration operation requires a mechanism to detect, in order to avoid damage to the malicious code.<br>

1.2.5databases and storage systems<br>
------

Block in a block chain network needs to be written to the database for storage.<br>
Observation block chain, a large number of write operations hash calculation and verification operation, and behavior of traditional databases are very different.<br>
At that time, i t was discovered that a large number of non - transactional applications query on the Internet, and designed a non- relational No SQL database. <br>
Therefore, we can design some special targeted database according to the block chaining application of these features - the key database, as the level of DBN Rocks DB, having high random write and read sequential, random read performance and relatively poor performance, hexyl It is widely used in the information storage block chain. Block - oriented database technology chain is still required by one of the technical problems to be broken. In my opinion, there may be more targeted, " Block database DBB" In the future, dedication to new types of data services, such as block chains, wherein each record includes a complete block information and information associated with nature and history .<br>
Confirmed once written, can not be modified. <br>
All operations will be the minimum unit is a block. <br>
lntegration long service system based on the new chain block will coexist with the existing centralized system. <br>
How the two systems co- exist, how they divide and how to conduct their business transactions spread?<br>
These are urgent problems.<br>
If this problem is not solved, i t will be a big obstacle blockchain technical landing.<br>

1.2.6Future development block chain<br>
------

At present, the development of the block chain is rapidly expanding.<br>
People are studying the deep operations block chain, so as to solve problems in the real secto r.<br>
What is the problem of the large- scale application block chain encountered?<br>
Let' s see. First of all, we are in technology.<br>
In Bitcoin, the block chain is the beginni ng of  pure digital, which is  in the digital world, things with the real world. This is just a simple hook a book, a day of accounting, in the form of mining and the use of currency prices.<br>
If the block chain technology and practice, i t will come out of the virtual world.<br>
This will to solve real problems through decentralization.<br>
But  the  real business model can  not  be  exactly the same.<br>
For example, there is a very complex settlement systems in the f inancial secto r. <br>
Block chain technique for complex clearing step process solution, but can not have the same rights to all nodes l iquidation.<br>
Block chain technology needs to adapt to the real world of logic and mechanisms from the practical application of the same process in the digital world. <br>
In addition, the bloc k chain is recording data, anyone can see books on the web, but  now is not feasible in real l i fe. For example, in the medical profession, patient records is very private and sensitive. <br>
This is not a requirement that everyone can access and view.<br>
This requires a block chain, to ensure the security and privacy of data.<br>
But there is no effective solution to this problem.<br>
Over t ime, we will have to work out a three - dimensional world, slope, layered block chain, pay more attention to data privacy, security, and application of l ine with the reality of l i fe.<br>

In order to achieve a profound thought and  decision - making, pointnity objective point  of view, we believe that only by using the block chain as a good ecological construction to improve the  system' s shortcomings, improve the  network can  block  island chain to realize high utilization, resulting in more more benign value.<br>
pointnity is an open, integrated block chain network and the initial network construction. <br>
It provides information on a homemade organization o r enterprise developers the basic technical architecture of the complex, so pointnity is a developer - friendly gathering place.<br>
What is pointnity:<br>
POINTNITY NETWORK was founded in Japan in November 2017 by the CEO ( shi ゅ u ke い    wa  san) as  sponsors, the purpose is  to create a  focus on  eco- compatible,  interactive collaboration, solve technical, information si los  of  block chain technology  research  and development team organization.<br>
POINTNITY NETWORK think to the center of the block chain, occult, can not be cha nged and other characteristics brought about by technological innovation will allow more individuals, groups, organizations, understanding, contact centers use to block chain and related technologies products.<br>
POINTNITY NETWORK is committed to building a h igh- compliant distributed interactive system.<br>
Provide distributed storage block chain information display service, rescue island information, so that information can be a strong conceptual resource assistance, and lowering the barriers to technology develo pment more block chain start - up team, to provide one- stop solution programs and best supporting stack.<br>
The improved consensus algorithm provides the Byzantine system across the chain can interact with external collaboration. <br>
Within the system can be secure d multi- channel transaction aptamer chain, to achieve low friction, low - latency, high- throughput transaction status, and to provide effective protection for the good, smooth ecological development, for which POINTYNITY is committed to providing a combinati on of internal and external interaction, height compatible, high - dimensional expansion of the block chain system.<br>


3.Pointnity network:<br>
--

In the  future, a  similar block chain will be  the center of  the internet and spoke model to integrate data and value. <br>
The future direction of the main block chain used will be achieved through the development of joint block chain to integrate these individual spoke.<br>
This integrated block chain network, will make any public or private organization to:<br>
•Integration: send data and values between any compatible with pointnity the block chain.<br>
•Expansion: provides fast transaction processing capabilities and increased data capacity for all pointnity block chain.<br>
•Spoke: allows you to create a customized public or private block chain to keep up with the other block chain interoperability, while allowing publishers to select governance, consensus mechanism, release, and participation.<br>
Pointnity core network is a unique design, open block chain. <br>
Designed for connecting other block chains and manage their own program chain bulk, pointnity also provides economic incentive system interoperability.<br>
pointnity token as a fuel of the entire network can be used to create a new block chain security, monetization across the chain bridge and protect the entire network.<br>
A f i rst block chain to achieve network connection.<br>
It is designed to be a fair,distributed, open the block chain framework to meet the requirements of a multi - layer network architecture block chain. <br>
As an open chain block users will be able to deploy their  own participation in the network, and communicate via a reliable infrastructure with other networks.<br>
Whether a large enterprise hosted private network, or community - based public network, you can connect to pointnity future, de centralized application can handle and integrate data from multiple block chain networks.<br>

Central distributed information processing, storage system:<br>
Central distributed information storage processing system has the following design goals:<br>
1.Named dispersed and found: the end user should be able to<br>
(A)) using human- readable and register names and<br>
(B)) mapping to f ind a human- readable name of the  network  resource, not  trust any remote party.<br>
2.. dispersed storage: end- users should be able to  use  distributed  stora ge system, where they can store their data and disclose i t to any remote party.<br>
3.. Reliable performance: the new architecture  ( including  name  /  resource discovery, storage, access, etc.) end- to- end performance should focus on the traditional Internet services.<br>

Until recently, decentralized system with human - readable name to be considered impossible to build and distributed storage systems, such as Bit Torrent' s, and so does not provide a performance / bandwidth is comparable to a centralized service pointn i ty proposed to solve these problems.<br>

3.1 underlying fault block chain of survival<br>
--

Our structure has not put any restrictions blockchain i t to use.<br>
Any blockchain may be used as long as i t provides a full sorting operation, but the safety and reliability characteristics depend directly on the underlying blockchain.<br>
We believe that the ability to migrate to a blockchain from another is very important, because i t allows larger systems to survive, even when the underlying blockchain compromised.<br>
Our architect ure also allows multiple potential blockchains and treatment blockchains as a whole provides a channel of communication and orderly functioning; as long as they can provide a complete and orderly operation of the individual underlying any number of communi cation channels can work.<br>

3.2And complex logic to maintain<br>
--

Many outside Blockchains blockchains, l ike Revenge, while achieving the control logic and data stored in the plane blockchain level ( although they leave open the possibility of using external data storage in the future).<br>
In our view, do not use blockchains for data storage is necessary scalability, security and scalability is very important and remain outside blockchains complex logic.<br>
Node on the network should not be required to calculate complex untrusted program just to keep pace with the network. In addition, i t is difficult,after they introduced new features already deployed and get real - world use, to blockchains. virtualchains us can be established in any state machine at the top of blockch ains without requiring any modification of the concept underlying blockchains.<br>
Total sort  operation, on an underlying abstraction of the  blockchains. As  our building, " 〃  waist and kept  outside the complex blockchains.<br>

3.3scalable global data index<br>
--

Any decentralized network would need an index to the data i t stores. <br>
Go back to the  early peer network, Napster has launched a centralized index decentralized f i le transfer in the year of 1999 Bit Torrent began to focus on tracking ( metrics), and later launched a DHT- based distributed index. DHT - based peer network is vulnerable to attack and Sybil historically unreliable and difficult to scale, especially in a huge loss.<br>
We have experienced these problems f i rst- hand as we pointnity initial peer network is based on a DHT Kademlia.<br>
We introduced a new  unstructured peer network, is  called Atlas network, address the  use  of the network - the specific case of dispersed storage case ( a) in a small volume of data sets and ( b) has all the the global l ist can be used to index the network project. Atlas, node maintains a copy of the state of 100 %.<br>
Easier to  achieve in an  unstructured method, there is no overhead for maintaining the routing structure, against targeted attacks node ( each node has a complete copy of the data) elasticity.<br>

3.4customized block chain:<br>
--

Currently decentralized application ( DAPP) will need to build on an underlying chain.<br>
Different business scenarios have different requirements for performance, consensus mechanisms underlying the public chain, to build a n application even need to own a bottom chain ( including private chain, chain alliances and public chain).<br>
However, the development  of a chain of adapting their underlying business often requires a certain technical threshold and t ime. There are a lot of businesses have no  landing scenario block chain to  understand  the underlying technical staff, on - l ine business needs as quickly as possible, even i f there are also difficult to build an entirely appropriate underlying chain in a short t ime.<br>
pointnity is a customizable block chain infrastructure, the team built a backbone, while the bottom part of the main chain has a modular, reusable components are open source, developers can assemble and modify different modules, to customize a different underlying chain.<br>
pointnity provides a very inclusive eco - system architecture, in which we can adjust themselves according to the conditions we need to develop a chimera, for the system to our needs.<br>
In this way, we can avoid the original open source end of the chain, long occupied the user base and ecosystem caused, this i s a huge challenge to the monopoly of the entrepreneu r. <br>
Now, we can replicate what we want, or need to pointnity and run with the help of pointnity, avoiding strong ecosystem initially difficult ecological construction.<br>
There are challenges and sources of difficulty, which makes the environment easier to build consensus easier to reach an agreement between development.<br>

4.Multi-chain interaction (cross-link), controlled authority business information, ecological cooperation show:<br>
--

Across the chain, as the name suggests, i t is through a technique that allows the value chain and cross the barriers between the chain, direct circulation.<br>
So how to understand the chain across i t?<br>
Block chain is a distributed ledge r.<br> 
A block chain is an independent books, two different chains, that is, two different independent books, books two unrelated. Essentially there is no way to transfer value between books, but for the value of a specific user, the user stored on a block chain, can become a value on the other strand, which is the f low of value.<br>

Say more obscure, we use swaps to understand i t convenient.<br>
RMB is an independent currency, the dollar is another independent currency.<br>
The yuan can not become a direct dollar, the dollar has not become a direct yuan.<br>
Therefore, the dollar can not directly enter  the books of RMB, the yuan can not enter the dollar books directly.<br>
We need someone willing to buy the yuan / dollar, sell USD / CNY to complete convertible currency, to  realize  the value of cross- f low of books.<br>
Alice has $ 100 , she came to China, need to use the yuan to trade.<br>
So she  must f ind And her people are willing to exchange foreign currency, such as Bob, Alice will sell
$ 10 Bob, Bob received Alice Give him $ 100 , according to the exchange rate at  the t ime, gave Alice 657 yuan. From the point of view books, foreign currency exchange of the entire process is l ike this.<br>
First,Alice has on the books of dollars to $ 100 , Bob has $ 0 in the dollar on the books; Alice 0 yuan RMB books, Bob 657 yuan RMB books.<br>
Alice to Bob then transfers the $ 100 dollars on books, Bob transfers to  Alice 657 RMB yuan in  RMB books.<br>
So,  Alice originally worth $  100   on dollar accounts in the books will be transferred to the account on the Ali ce books in
renminbi, reflected 657  yuan. <br>
In this process, the value of  Bob 657  yuan in  RMB books will  be transferred to the Bob account on  the books of  the dollar, reflecting the order of $  100 . <br>
The entire exchange process, the two books simultaneously on the transfer transaction.<br>
The nature and currency exchange across the chain are the same. <br>
Across the chain does not change the total value of each block in the chain, but was among the holders of a convertible has been.<br>
In summary, one of the core element s of technology across the  chain: the user on a chain to help Alice f ind the user Bob is willing to be redeemed on the other strand.<br>
From a business perspective, cross - l ink technology is an exchange, allowing users to be able to exchange the cross chain transactions. Because of different currencies in different block chain.<br>
The block i tself i s a chain of trust in order to solve problems that arise, then the user between the different blocks chain how to ensure that  their interests  are not compromised?<br>
Alice Bob to f ind the Bitcoin currency exchange as  Ethernet, i f  the Bitcoin transferred  to Alice Bob, but Bob i s not transferred to the Ethernet currency Alice, how to do?<br>
At this t ime, another action across the chain will show up: the use of i ts credit to provide transitive trust when the exchange transaction.<br>
Particular method of operation, the currency is usually transferred to the bit exchange Alice, Bob ether credits transferred to the exchange, and then exchange credits transferred to Alice Ethernet, token bits transferred Bob.<br>
By the middle of the exchange held on behalf of a digital currency, to achieve the transfer of trust so that transactions between Alice and Bob can proceed. Alice entire trust transfer is trust exchange, Bob trust exchange, so build trust between Alice and Bob.<br>

The nature of cross-chain block chain 4.1<br>

The whole real world have moved on a block chain is not realistic, real world i tself is divided inheritance economic f ield was value creation, by market value to achieve different industries and different areas of economic exchange. <br>
Each separate block chain maintains i ts own independent economic value system, is connected across the chain block chain backbone chain of independent blocks, carrying a different value system function block chain of value exchange, commodities to be able to interact, the need for prices,commodity prices from their value, depending on supply and demand, but by market supply and demand relationship is built, so, in order to achieve different block chain " commo dity" value exchange, in a cross- chain block chain will be a variety the market value of the transaction, the value of each transaction on the market across the chain block chain is a chain across service contract.<br>
Value does not come out of nowhere and wi l l not suddenly disappear, across the design chain must comply with economic laws of mankind since ancient t imes.<br>
The nature of cross- chain is the equivalent exchange value, any violation of the basic principles of design will eventually fail.<br>

4.2block chain cross chain architecture model<br>
--

Separate block chain of architectural models already in the foregoing description, and all independent block chain i f you need support across the value chain transfer or  exchange,  we need to be present outside the chain of service contracts, service contracts outside the chain of contracts with general services are not essential difference, but also a service contract statute, except that the contract makers will provide a set of chain transactions across public statement of public address, you need to cross the main chain transaction can own a certain amount of value transferred to on cross - chain contract services specified public address, and specify the chain across the transaction, such as a certain amount of hope that the exchange value of  the body of  another block chain, and the value of  the body  on their own after the exchange to another block chain the public key on the address.<br>
It is assumed that there are two separate block chain A and B, there is  a  main body  X  and Y, they have private addresses on the two chains, the main producers of X is the value on the block chain A, such as farmers produce food , Y is  the value of  the main producers on  the block chain B, such as industrial plant, the main X wants to  buy  a  pr oduct or  service on  the block chain B, such as industrial products, the main Y want to buy products on the block chain a or services, such as food. Cross chain block chain of the main chain composed of two types, one  is  a  main chain backbone chain span onl y  one  A- chain is  an  aptamer, the aptamer strand there are at least two, a cross - connect backbone chain each aptamer strand, there is no trust relationship between the respective sub - chains, but passed through the main chain of trust. Aptamer chain and the main chain to interact in accordance with the protocol set, in order to achieve the purpose of the trust transfer and transaction delivery.<br>
Combined with the above example to explain the chain across our value chain for inter- exchange process  will be  explained.<br>
Here only  barter market, for  example, the  main producers of X is the value on the block chain A, Y is the value of the main producers on the block chain B, X i f you  want to  get  the value of  the main body of  the block chain B,  We  need to exchange contracts with the main service Y to achieve an equivalent value of barter to get the body through cross- block chain a value chain.<br>
First body X need to be added outside the chain of service contracts on the A chain, contract law rules  and  accept the terms  of  service contract provisions, subject X  also need to add  a  chain across service contracts, such  as  trade matching AOB  can  be  achieved across a chain of service contracts, contract rules and legal provisions of the receiving chain transactions across the market.<br>
Then subject X to be in accordance with the rules of the contract outside the chain of service contracts on the  A  chain, the  value chain of  own  body A certain amount of chain transfer to outside contract services specified public address,and specify the content across the chain transactions, such as I wish to exchange a set number of  another body block chain B  value, and the value of  the  body after the exchange to i ts own public address on another block chain.<br>
Subsequent transaction process is as follows:<br>

4.3Building and packaging across the chain transactions<br>
--

Adapted by the chain code on the block chain A chain across the body designated X transaction request content ( with a certain amount of value in the chain thereof A certain number of B chain redemption value thereof to the address specified public key) to
generate a daughter strand transactions, and packaged into sub - blocks chain.<br>

Cross-provided sub-chain chain transactions 4.4 proved, initiate the backbone chain across service invocations Chain l ink adaptation code gives a cross transaction request is present on the molecular chains of the proof, and in accordance with the protocol inter - strand, across the package starting backbone chain to service calls based on Merkle tree.<br>

4.5implementation of the main chain cross chain transaction code<br>
---

Backbone bus service across the chain, the chain of verification on the child sex trade there is proof, analysis of cross - body X chain transaction request content, the chain across service call routing to speci f ic cross- value chain exchange contracts.<br>
The same procedure, Y across the main chain of a transaction request ( with the chain on a certain number of B chain redemption value thereof A certain number of public key value to the specified address thereof) is  also sent  to  the same value chain across swaps. <br>
Permit consensus - based  l ightweight BFT protocol to follow, which transaction processing round instead of multiple rounds. <br>
Each verifier according to their assessment of the previous block view of a transaction.<br>
If more than two- thirds or two- thirds vote of the verifier is yes, then cross the transaction chain is considered valid, at this t ime next block chain transactions considered valid.<br>
From the start state, we need to bridge the verifier to wait until i t receives the cross- chain transactions, and then verify the validity of the signature and transaction costs.<br>
According to the validity of the transaction, i t will be deleted verifier ( unsigned), or signature and spread to the connection or destination network. <br>
Verifier can be rewarded from across the chain transaction fee, and may be given a portion of the block reward.<br>
Target cost allocation i s equitable distribution policy. Internally, all costs are allocated to  the bridge to bridge verifier. This ratio ca n be placed on the bridge i s completed for each certifier may be divided equally complete. <br>
On the outside, bridge and other bridges routing path network connection and verifier share transaction costs across the chain. <br>
There are two possible external costs of distribution modes: • chain transactions across the sender specifies the cost allocation between the bridge and connect to  the  network.<br>
The  advantage of this method is that users can choose to optimize the cost of the bridge according to the load and the lowest rate.<br>
The disadvantage is that before sending the transaction, the user needs a basic understanding of routing paths and cost requirements of each bridge.<br>
The sender only hardcoded agreement protocol or the total cost, and the connecting network bridges share the cost.<br>
The advantage of  this method is  that the user easier. <br>
A  disadvantage of this method is that, i f not difficult, to change the ratio between the bridge and the connecting network is slow.<br>
Code Cross chain value exchange contracts to a chieve, does all the AOB trade matching, forming a trading market depth with the B chain value body of a A chain value body, once the match on the main transaction request X and the main body of Y, to form a match transaction for the package a and B chains to achieve the results the value exchanged between the main body X and Y. Cross - chain value exchange contract is essentially a f ield Stock Exchange.<br>

Chain adaptation of code initiates transactions to transfer outside the chain of command on contract service independent blocks corresponding to each chain.<br> 
A chain aptamer chain will send a transaction to transfer outside the chain A chain of service contracts, indicating the value of the body to the body designated Y address from the public address public contracts transfer a certain numbe r. B chain aptamer will send a
transfer transactions outside the chain of contracts to service B chain, which indicates t hat  the value specified in the main body to X from the public address public address transfer
contract of a certain number.

4.7implementation of the code outside the chain contract
---

A service contract outer chain strand will contract the code executed, gen erates a transaction, a number of the body is controlled by the value of the contract, to transfer instructions to transfer the specified subject public key Y address. Contract services
outside the chain B chain will execute the contract code generates a t ransaction, the value
of a certain number of bodies controlled by the contract transfer instructions to transfer  the body to the X address specified public key.
Generate a transaction log, update status books
Once the transaction i s packed into blocks, acc ording to characteristics of the
transaction confirmation chain, ultimately the body of the B - chain of X obtained control value of the body, the body Y material obtained control value of the A - chain.
Cross chain block chain will also provide the user  interface UI  and  API interface, users  of all transactions executed on the cross chain block chain contract services can interface
to get the current status of the implementation of the user interface and API across the
chain, that is, to see the user in th e transaction the pending sale of the state and market depth, and even allows users to  follow based on  the  private market supply and demand   re- entry orders.
Cross chain block chain may provide a mechanism outside the chain - based mortgage
contract services on a separate block chain, on the corresponding aptamer chain of value in exchange for the same number of chips or body phantom block chain of mortgage, take the main business body phantom value chain on the child' s participation in the main chain of

Pointnity Network is not only a separate block chain network, and support cross - functional communication chain bridge, such as cross - asset swap chain cross chain assets and
portability. By using Pointnity Network platform, anyone can  develop applications based  on the f inancial requirements of the application scenarios. Pointnity Network technology the basic idea is to use the cross l ink chain thought the relay, and the cross - l ink
communications module is implemented as a node complete covering layer on the basic chain ointnity Network. In this technology roadmap, we have not only maintained cross

chain interoperability of independence, but also reuse the various functions Pointnity Network provides basic chain.

Pointnity Network acts as a gateway between the original block to another chain. Each node has two merge queues, respectively process incoming and outgoing transac t ions
affairs. In addition, the combined node should have some original block token chain and  the chain support cross Oracle.

5.1certifier
---

Verify people packed the new block in Pointnity Network network. People need to verify  the deposit mortgage enough, because we allow other people to nominate one or more

funds of elected representatives may verify their people, so people verify the deposit is
not part of their own, but belongs to the nominee . A verification must run a Relay chain of clients in the high- availability and high- bandwidth machines. On each block node must be
ready to receive the new block on a parallel chain i t has been submitted. This process
involves acceptance, validation, and then release candidate blocks. Verify The  appointment is deterministic, but in fact i t is difficult to predict. Because people can not be expected to verify all data with full synchronous parallel chains, so they want to block the  work of  the new proposal parallel chains assigned to a third party, that is, the collection of people.
Once the different authentication - person team are definitively approved the new block they belong parallel chains, they must begin their approval Relay chain of blocks. This
includes updating the status of the transaction queue ( that is, the transfer from the exit queue a parallel chain to another queue into a parallel chain), has approved the
transaction processing Relay chain of collection, approval of the f inal blocks the  absorption  of parallel chains eventually change .
In the consensus algorithm we choose, i t will not fulfill their duty to punish a person

( double- signing), or conspire to provide an i l legal block and so on can proof of malicious behavior, cause them to lose all deposit ( down a small part, most of the informat ion

certifier ( or groups) can represent them maintain the entire network. According to the proportion of their deposit, they will be subject to verification and deposit the same
proportion of the total people incentives and deductions. And the following collection of people, miners nominee and current Po W network similar.

Trading is to help people collect verified person who makes an effective parallel chain
block groups. They will run a full node to  a  specific parallel chains, which means they  have  all the necessary information, the new block can be packaged and executed transactions.
About collectors, the precise relationship nominee, certifier may also be modified. At f i rst, we want to gather people who can work closely with verification, because ther e may be
only a few ( or even a) small volume parallel chains. The initial implementation will
comprise a client RPC interface to support efficient parallel block chain collectors node to a parallel chain provable unconditionally supplied to a ( Relay chain) certifier node.  Because the cost of maintaining all fully synchronous parallel chains of higher and higher, so we
designed an additional structure facilitates the separation of independent economic - driven, and other participants.
Ultimately, we want to see groups of people in order to collect more fees, competitively to collect information. Over a period of t ime, in order to continue to grow share of earnings
bonus, these collectors may only serve specific groups of people verified.

5.4Ombudsman

Unlike the other two parties, the Ombudsman does not block the process and packaged directly related. They are independent of the " bounty hunter", encouraging them is a
one- t ime large reward.
Rather, due to the presence of the Ombudsman, we can reduce the incidenc e of malicious behavior, even want to happen just because the private key is not accidentally leaked,
rather than deliberate malicious intent. The starting point of this name is given to the frequency they expect earnings and the size of the f inal award.
Ombudsman with t imely reporting and prove the existence of at least one of the
participants in the mortgage i l legal behavior, they can be rewarded. Il legal behavior comprises two different blocks have the same sign parent block, or an invalid block
approval on  parallel chains. To  prevent the transition to  the bonus  because the private key  is  revealed as  a  result of  the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman' s  report i l legal messages about  a single person to verify the signature of the foundation is to award from the small est
beginning, this award will be reported more i l legal signature with other ombudsman
gradually increase. According to our basic security assumed that: at least two - thirds of the verifier is honest, asymptote will be set at 66 %.
Ombudsman and  to  some extent the  current node block the whole chain  of  similar,
relatively few resources they need, there is no need to promise stable online t ime and large bandwidth. The Ombudsman has so much different, so they only need to submit a small deposit. The deposit for the prevention of waste of computational t ime to verify people and witches attack computing resources. It can withdraw cash immediately,
probably not more than the equivalent of a few dollars, but i f the monitoring to verify a person' s misconduct, may gain great rewards.


6consensus mechanism
--

6.1Casper consensus
--

Casper is a consensus based on the margin of economic incentive agreement
( security- deposit based economic consensus protocol). Agreement node, as " locked margin verifier ( bonded validators)", you m ust f i rst pay a deposit ( this step is called to lock the
margin, " bonding") before they can participate in the formation of a block and consensus.
Casper consensus agreement through direct control of these margin constraint validation
to human behavior. Specifically, that is,  to  verify i f  a  person has  made anything Casper that " invalid", his deposit will be forfeited, and the right to participate in a block consensus
will be canceled. The introduction of margin solve " nothing at stake" , Which is the classi c POS protocols do bad things low cost problem. Now, with the price, but objectively prove something wrong certifier will pay this price. We easily found only in the case of a cash
deposit to verify who currently has his signature makes sense ( economically meaningful).
This means that the client can only rely on what they know to lock margin of verifying the signatures. So when the client receives the data and identification of consensus, consensus approval of the chain must originate from the people curren t ly locked margin verification block. In the POW agreement approved by consensus chain i t is originated in the creation
block - as long as you know the data creation block you can identify consensus recognized chain. Here, as long as you know the margin of verifying people currently locked, you can identify consensus recognized chain. We do not know who currently locked deposit
verification l ist client must f i rst obtain the l ist through another channel. This restriction to

solve the " long- range attack ( long range attack)" issue by requiring owners with
information to identify the current consensus. Verify the l ist of people with the certifier margin constantly locked, confiscated, unlock and change. If a client goes offline for too
long, i t will verify the l ist of people due to the outdated and can not be used to identify a consensus. If the client is always online, i t is possible to keep pace with the latest l ist of validation, but the problem is before the f i rst synchronization, the client still need to get
the latest l ist of  verified lock margin of  people from other channels. This " need to  identify  a consensus from the other channels at least once" in nature. In our context, i f the
information can be verified in the Agreement can be called " objective"; i f t he information must rely on  external means of  verification protocol is  available, i t  is  called " subjective." In the weak subjectivity consensus agreement, the bifurcation selection rules are  stateful, so the client must be initialized ( sometimes i t is upda ted) in this state in order to identify consensus. Here, this state is used to verify the identify people currently locked margin
( probably more accurate to say that the current l ist of people to verify cryptographic hash).


6.2Mortgage Token

Gambling on Consensus Casper asked to verify the majority of people will bet  on  the  result  of a consensus in the margin. The results and the formation of a consensus by the certifier betting situation: verification must guess which block others would bet on to win, bu t also  bet this block. If you bet on, they can get back margin plus transaction costs, and perhaps  there are some emerging currencies; i f the bet is not quickly agree, they can  only get back part of the deposit. Therefore, the distribution of betting after a few rounds to verify
people will converge. Also verify i f people are too significant to change the bet, for
example, f i rst bet on a block has a high probability of winning, and then change the bet another block with a high probability of winning, he wil l be severely punished. This rule
ensures that only people in the verification pretty sure other people think there is a high probability of a block when winning a high probability bet. Through this mechanism to
ensure that there is a bet to converge to a result and then converge to the results of
another case, as long as the verifier enough. POW consensus can also be understood as a mechanism bet: Choose a block based on i ts miners were mining, is betting the block will become part of the backbone; If you bet on, he can receive a reward, and i f the bet is
wrong he will lose electricity. As long as all the miners will count their forces to bet on the same chain, so that this chain has the largest amount of work ( force immediate count bet
prediction, betting is considered the result of force), the consensus is safe. Operator POW economic value bet with increasing force l inear growth of the number of confirmed and
verified in Casper who can make a bet by coordinating the proportion of exponential growth, so that a consensus quickly achieve maximum security.

6.3whole network punishment mechanism
--

Independent verification of people bet on each candidate block on  each  height, each block  is assigned to a winning probability and published. By  repeatedly bet  for  each  person will be selected height verify only one winner block, this process also determines the
transaction ( transaction) the order of execution. If a verifier in  the  probability distribution of the sum of a  highly published more than 100 %,  or  announced the  probability is  less than  0 %, or an invalid block is specified for the probability of greater than 0  percent, Casper will  be forfeited his deposit.
When the lock margin verification of the vast majority of people ( who meet the group of

validation protocol defined thresholds: margin levels to a percentage of between 67 % to  90 %) with very high probability ( eg,> 99 . 9 %) of a bet when a block that does not contain any of the fork block can not win, then we say that this block is the f inal confirmation
( f inal). Further, i f the client f inds all the blocks are smaller than the height H of the f inal confirmation, then the client is always at a height H not accept - states of blocks obtained
do not entirely the same state and the diverging of the order of 1 . In  this ca se we say that   the state ( H - 1 - high status) have been f inal confirmation. There are therefore two f inal
confirmation related trades: transaction ( i . e. corresponding to the f inal block, then all of this prior to trade execution height) at a f inal confirm ation of a particular height to be
performed, and after the f inal confirmation of the transaction execution state ( and all blocks corresponding block needs below this height be f inal).

6.4System anti-examination
--

One of the biggest threats to the miners f orm a consensus agreement is to the detriment of non- members at the expense of profit maximization member of the alliance. If Casper
verify people' s income mainly consists of fees, a majority coalition will be able to obtain greater benefits f i l ter through a block of other nodes. Trading Not only that, the attacker can also bribe nodes to eliminate specific address given, as long as  the majority of  nodes  are rational, they will be able to join together to f i l ter out the specified block does not
reject the t ransaction. In order to withstand the majority coalition attack, Casper the
consensus process as a cooperative game, to ensure that each node can only be achieved by  the Union in the best interests of all the nodes of ( at least when interest is mainly
composed of the agreement rewards the case constructed so) . If p% of the people involved
in the consensus verify the game, then they will get f ( p) ≤ p% of revenue; i f 100 % of the
people involved in the verification can get more in return. More specifically, Casper those who would not punish validation agreement the order of the blocks. Protocol will notice a sequence departing from the block, and the certifier margin and the corresponding fees
withheld. In addition, by winning bet returns the number of people involved in  verifying  the consensus of the game is l inear ( or super - l inear) relationship.

6.5Caspar optimization scalability
--

The answer is l ikely to be determined, and the reason is not so much Casper block chain architecture as i t is on the economics of Casper. But Casper block chain design does
support the consensus faster than the POW block interval. Verify people' s income i s l ikely that only transaction costs, so they have a direct incentive to increase Gas cap, as long  as  they load the server. But i f thus creating additional processing capacity relatively weak
authentication people can not keep up the rhythm, their income will become less. So Gas  cap verify only accept everyone who can afford to rise. Miner ( Miners) hardware
investment is to buy more mining machine ( count force), and verify people' s hardware
investment is the way i t will upgrade the server to obtain higher throughput. Miners also gained momentum higher throughput can purchase hardware, but i t is  much weaker than  the force of the power purchase count. Relative to the POW, to achieve l ight - based client  on the margin of the POS easier. Specifically, l ight up the block without having to
download the client access to safe identification of consensus, or trade execution to ensure effectiveness of the economy. Most of the cost will only affect the certifier consensus, i t
will not affect the l ight client. Light client can also be  reserved for  low  latency capabilities  of the premise to identify consensus.

What responsibility 6.6Verification

As a certifier locking margin, you  need to sign and  block betting in  the  consensus process.  If you pay a large sum of deposit, you may want to deploy a Multiple servers consisting of multi- signature verification environment to do work to reduce server is black or lead to
abnormal risk. Such programs need to help repeated experiments and technical experts. In order to maximize the benefits, people need to stay online validation service and stable as possible. DDo S protection service is necessary. Your rate of ret urn also depends on other
people' s verification process performance and availability, which means that there is a risk that you can not directly resolve here. If the performance of other nodes you will not
suffer! But this t ime, i f you decide not to partic ipate fully consensus you will lose more.
However, additional risk usually means higher returns, especially when risk has been recognized and will never happen.
Applications and their users can turn to change in Casper get many benefits from POW. Low latency confirmation can greatly improve the user experience. Final deal soon under
normal circumstances. If there is a network partition occurs, the transaction will still be
executed, and the transaction has been revoked possibility of this situation will be clearly reported to the application and i ts users. When application developers still need to deal
with the situation bifurcation, POW and use the same protocol, but here the consensus agreement will give a clear possibility that the transaction revocation measure.

7.1Overview
--

Scalability is distributed computing and parallel computing Important index, which describes the ability of the system to dynamically adjust their computing performance by changing the available computing resources and scheduling. Scalabi l i ty is divided into two aspects of hardware and software. Scalability refers to the hardware is by changing the hardware resources to meet workload changes, such as changing the number of processors, memory and hard disk capacity. Software scalability by changing the degree of  parallelism  and scheduling to meet workload changes. Measurement, design and testing are three main aspects of the research system scalability.
Metrics • Scalability is the basis for the design  and  testing  of  scalable  systems. However, due to the complex and diverse scalable system environment, so a system to accurately measure the scalability is very challenging. General measure  is  by  loading different system resources and system load changes to evaluate the performance of the system in this process. In  the  best  case, i f  both of  the  workload and  computing resources  K- fold increase  or decrease,  and the average  response  t ime invariant  systems or applications, the system has optimal scalability.
•on- demand dynamic allocation and scheduling of resources is an important basis for system scalability. For conventional distributed and parallel systems, when the workload changes, resource management and scheduling mechanism determines the efficiency of the underlying system application scalability. High efficiency management resource scheduling mechanism,  in  the  case  where  the  workload  increases,  more  resources  can  be  allocated t ime for the systems and applications, systems and applications that can be calculated
Force in a short  t ime  to  adapt  to  the  large  workload, avoid plummeting computing power; in the case of reduced workloads, the t imely recovery of resource  constraints,  increase system utilization of resources,  reserves  set aside for the rest  of  the  application. Conversely, the lower the efficiency of resource scheduling tube Request for change management mechanism is not sensitive resources, will result in allocation of resources or recycling is not enough t ime and adequate.
•The test is based on the testing and evaluation of s calability. Currently there are two levels of scalability tests: 1 ) the test code levels; 2 ) system level test. Code level for  each  code block i s a parallel program, the impact on the scalability of the detection system. Typically using statistical methods for parallel  statistical modeling  algorithms,  Ken according to the results of several experiments statistical evaluation of the  contribution of the block system performance, scalability

define a weight parameter, so that the entire analysis scalability of parallel programs. The system- level testing method is to monitor the pre - analysis results and real- t ime operating state of the workload, and pre- analyzed results combining real - t ime monitoring, analysis of the entire system scalability.
With the development of cloud computing and other distributed computing platform
technology, S 0 A ( Service- Oriented Architecture) and Saas ( Software as a Service) and other new software development paradigm of development for scalability put forward higher
requirements. For example, cloud computing and Saas proposed the concept of " unlimited
resources", providing mass sharing of resources for large - scale applications, highly scalable capacity. Scalability has become the  basis for  new  services and  critical computing model, but also the traditional measure of scalability, design and testing technologies presents
new challenges. On the basis of the above existing research and practice research and
analysis work on further discuss challenging issues scalability study of cloud comp uting platform services software.

7.2Scalability is defined
--

It gives a definition of scalability: Scalability refers to  the  network, system  or  process can be supported  by capacity  expansion  greater workloads  own resources.  He will scalability be divided into four  categories:  load  scalability,  spatial  scalability,  temporal and spatial scalability and architecture scalability. 1Scalability refers to the  load transition  in the system can smoothly varying workload by adjusting the resources to meet the load change, no t ime delay exceeds a predetermined l imit and resource consumption in the regulation process. 2 Spatial scalability is a l imit to the regulation system resources, i . e. resources in the case where the load increases, the occupied ( memory, disk space, etc.) and  the load increases l inearly up, supported by the prohibited  Resources  do  increasing  infinitely practice load. 3 Scalability refers to the t ime and space at a given operating t ime requirements under ( t ime), by extending the resource ( empty) to meet the increased load, while the application of the extended run t ime still meet  the  requirements. 4 Scalability refers to the structure to achieve a structure can easily be expanded and adjusted on the resource.
Existing studies to further explore the Scalabil i ty is defined in the specific f ield of application, the concept of multi - dimensional, and the dimension to  be  representative of  the behavior of the system affect the part of the  application  [ 4 ] ;  and  discussion  in  the range of the telescopic system require ments of [ 3 ] . In [ 3 ] , the scalability is defined: for a particular set of requirements, under different loads, the utilization of system resources remains unchanged. For scalability metrics, i t makes sense, so also produced multiple dimensions scalability metrics at specific areas. [ 3 ] gives three examples of dimensions: efficiency, storage space, and the number of access points. In the dimension processing efficiency, the processing efficiency of the system for information is the most important indicator of the impact of the behavior of the  system  that  guides  the  behavior  of  the system to adjust resources to adapt to the load. In this indicator, you can be more specific measure of scalability. Similarly, storage space and access points purpose dimension, stretching behavior of the system by the storage space and access  points aim  to  influence  and guide. Some studies have further expanded scalability dimension [ S], a proposed performance multiple dimensions, economic, physical size, addressing, software independence, communication capabilities, and  alternative technical independence and  the l ike.
In   practical  applications,  the   scalability  is   defined   as   a   resource  that   the  service
performance  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  l inear  ( ideal  case)  generates  growt h  [ 7 ] .

There are two ways to increase the resources: one is the expansion,  one  is  external expansion. The expansion means to a single computing node better performance, increased speed and increased cost of hardware resources, including adding more memory, faster processors, or to add more, or just moved to the application function more powerful single computer. It is extended to increase the number of nodes increased computing resources. External expansion increases the number of computing nodes, managemen t presented a greater challenge. As can be seen from Figure 1 , additional resources, extended extender is easier than optimal scalability; and extended in this manner can be increased or decreased more f lexibly computing nodes.


7.3Scalability of Measurement Methods
--

 Of  measurement can  be  reduced is  basic design and test the scalability of  the system,  i t has been widely discussed in a parallel and  distributed computing systems. As early  as  1990 , Mark D.  Hil P]  f i rst proposed using an  accelerometer to defin e  scalability. false Let be a Scale processing system of n processors for the execution of t ime required for the work, acceleration is defined as speedup ( N, x> - t ime ( L, x)  Ainie < n,; i  :),  i . e., the same size for  the problem, when the desired ratio and using a " preclude processor execution t ime. The concept of acceleration, based on  efficiency is  defined as ef  f  iciencytn, work) =  speedupin,  x) / n, I. e., the ratio of the number of processor speed. The efficiency of all algorithms If a system is 1 , then the system is scalable. In other words, the  same  scale  of  the  problem, using n processors to perform the required t ime is to use 1 / n 1 processors. The above definition is mainly based on  the  scale of  the  problem under  the  same conditions, changes in the number of processors study changes to the system  performance.  But  there  is  a problem in a large number of sequential code execution, and the processor enough ( e. g. greater than the size of the problem), the system efficiency  i s  low.  In  addition,  the definition can not measure the magnitude of change in performance when the problem size changes.
Most scalability metric is defined in parallel systems, mainly based on the speed and efficiency based on a method of speedup.
•speed- based method
It is the ratio of the speed of work and the t ime required  for  completion  of  one  computing node. The methods are based on the speedisospeed [ 9 ]  and isospeed- efficien-

Suppose there are N processors when at work, W is a complete work required algorithm, in order to ensure constant average speed, the algorithm working assumptions required when JV '> N processors work, W'  is  completed amount, N  ^  to  scale from the  system scalability is 4  ( JV ,   i V ' ) s JV' W / NW ^. If no communication i s between  processors,  each  processor  has  a working copy, then w '= N, W / N, 0 ( N, N /) = 1 O Under normal circumstances, WSi V' W / JV,

Isospeed method can effectively measure homogeneous system scalabili ty. In order to
measure heterogeneous system scalability, Sun Xian - HeAlso proposedisospeed- efficiency methods. Before introducing isospeed - efficiency method, we need to know  a  few definitions:
•A marking speed computing node refers to a node of the sustain ed speed.

contain.
•Assume S is the actual growth rate, W workload,: T is the execution t ime, then S = W

•Assume CSpeed marking system, the efficiency of a speed £ s = s / C = W / TC.
Suppose C, W, and the system are the initial marking speed, and the work execution

famous Amdah Ps Law ^ 121 gives the definition of the most basic speedup . speedup = - One, which r, + rp = \, r s Is a sequence of n + program i t n execution ratio of the portion, a ratio of parallel execution portion.
On the basis of the Amdahl' s Law, Sun Xian - He proposes four speedup [ 12143 , respectively speedup f ixed size, f ixed execution t ime speedup, generally with  l imited memory and speedup speedup [ U]. To give a few definitions:

7.4Distributed Resource Scheduling and Management
-

Distributed resource  management  is the foundation  of distributed systems  and applications, the efficiency of resource allocation and scheduling directly determines the upper system and application scalability. This section analyzes two modes distributed resource scheduling and management systems typically they correspond.
Distributed Resource  Scheduler  resource  scheduling  around,  build a resource management system, monitoring the status of each resource, the state feedback t o the resource scheduler  basis for decision - making.  The allocation  scheduler  made, the underlying operation of the resource assigning resources on different nodes. Resource allocation and resource operations can affect the scalability of the system, the pr ogram determines the resources needed tasks can be scheduled t ime, and  the  operating efficiency  is determined resource scheduling resources for t ime - consuming,  both  the  joint  decision the system for mission needs and resources change change of reaction t im e, thus affecting scalability.
According to the core control program whether the resource allocation, distributed resource management system can be divided into central and distributed modes. Center scheduling of distributed resource management system for all resource requests to the dispatcher core processing, each node to allocate resources from the core program. And distributed scheduling request received by the one computing  node  that  interacts  with  other nodes and negotiation to complete resource alloc ation.

7.4.1center scheduling mode
---

Distributed scheduling central resource management system typically consists of four components, which are the scheduler, information storage center, and local resource  allocator resource manager. Scheduling system gener ally center of the frame shown in FIG.
1 Early devices tune ~ h'~ Disappeared consultation resources' task
information storage center I
I	1 -? - New stays source, task information Resource allocation l i fe resource allocation command
I  local  resource is  to  1  I  managed locally owned I Cl	I	management I  Local resources ~  i  I  Local resource  ~~ i	I Local resources 1 ~


FIG center scheduling resource management framework 2

In this framework, four components function as follows. .
Scheduler: a recipient who is performing resource scheduling algorithms and the scheduling request, i t according to the specific content of the request, to store the state information stored in the center resources and tasks based on the information, a resource allocation calculated by scheduling algorithm program, and to pass this program to the resource allocator.
Information Storage Center: stores real - t ime status information resource and task information is based scheduler to make resource allocation  scheme,  the  scheduler  can obtain this information by means of active queries.
Resource allocator: executor actual resource allocation scheme, resource allocation scheduler administered will be split into smaller units, i . e., resource allocation command. Each resource allocation command i s a tuple, includes a resource identifier and a node corresponding to the number of  resources in  the  resource node  to  be  assigned. At the same t ime, resource allocator also responsible for updating the information stored in the center.
Local resource managers: a monitoring and resource allocator on each resource node, i t receives resource assignment command, task running state and resources on the node is requesting allocation amount of resources, and monitors the local node, to these states feedback to the resource allocator, update the information stored in the data center by the resource allocator.
Having a central dispatch resource management system are representative of resource management framework to Karl Czajkowski element calculation proposed by [ 19 ] , Legio J®  and Nimrod / G [ 21 ] . Here will be described a workflow system dispatch center by Legion.
In Legion, the resource node using  the  resource  reservation  mechanism  to  allocate local resources. That is, for a particular resource allocation command, th e command i s transmitted to the monitor after parsing a resource nodes corresponding to the node  according to a  command to  reserve resources for  the  task,  the  task is completed before,  the resources are not occupied. Meanwhile, the resource node is also  re sponsible  for updating the status of tasks and resources, i t can add i ts own  initiative  or  update  information collection center, collection center can also ask information resource node  to  get the information they need.
Legion, a typical resource allocation process is as follows.
1)Decision steps of:  receiving a  resource request dispatcher, and  content information  via a state inquiry information collection center resolution request tasks and resources, to generate a resource allocation scheme in a ccordance with pre- defined scheduling policy.
2)Negotiation procedure: resource allocator received from the scheduler at resource allocation plan, test  the  legality of  the  plan. If legitimate, you  step into the  assignment; i f  i l legal ( for example, on a resource allocation exceeds the number of nodes  required  resources are available), the resource allocator will consult with the scheduler, draw a new legal program. Consultation is based on information gathered in the center of information  and resource allocation.
3)Allocation step: resource allocator according to legal resource allocation, set aside resources to send commands to the monitor, the monitor command after receiving  the required number of reserved resources to the task at hand locally.  After  reac hing  the mission, monitors start the task, and the task of  monitoring the  local  operating conditions and status of the local resources.
4)Information Update: after the task starts running, the resource node update or add tasks and resource center to collect information according to predetermined t ime intervals status information, information collection center can also take the initiative to query information on the resource node.
More than four steps cycle,  after  the  end  of  the  updating,  in   a  new  round  of decision- making steps and start again, request assign the task to the next,  until  after resource scheduling all tasks are completed, the cycle stopped.
Center scheduling of resource management can better maintain the scalability of the system when the system load is small, because the scheduler can obtain status information

for all of the tasks and resources of the system from the information storage  center,  according to the information to make quick one - step decision- making and resource  allocation command to the  resource allocator to  complete. However, when the  system load  is large, the scheduler needs many requests  handled frequently,  resulting   in  slower response scheduler, the system takes a long t ime to reschedule, poor scalability of  the system.

7.4.2distributed scheduling mode
--

Legion resource distribution frame is based on the aforementioned center scheduling. The disadvantage is also obvious dispatch center, i t is only one component to make resource
allocation decisions, this component can easily beco me the bottleneck of  the system. When    i t appears the problem When the resource allocation system will not be continued.
Distributed scheduling a plurality of frame members are able to fulfill the functions of components of the resource allocation, thus avoi ding a significant system bottleneck.
Distributed scheduling mode resource management system, the nodes are connected to
each other through a communication configuration of FIG, any node can be connected and their synergistic partners to meet the resource request received.
For a distributed scheduling mode of each node, i t has three components.
1)Communication components: for partners  and other nodes to  communicate, collaborate and is the basis for decision - making among resource nodes.
2)Dec ision component: the core node control unit determines the collaborative way between the node and the f inal resource allocation algorithm specified.
3)Loc al resource management components: monitor the status of local resources, the decision to provide the basis for decision - making components.
ARMS ( Agent- based Resource  Management System) [ 20 ] is a typical distributed resource management system scheduling mode. Agent is autonomous intelligent software entity that has autonomy,  through  communication  between  each  other  in  the  case  of goal- driven between social, reactivity and adaptability characteristics, Agent, to changes in the external environment and events make in response, the completion of certain tasks. In ARMS, each Agent embodies a resource in the system. Agent organized i n a hierarchy, the structure shown in FIG. 5 , FIG Each node is an Agent.

FIG 5 Arms hierarchy of Aqent
ARMS is divided into three layers in the Agent, namely the local resource management, collaboration, and communications layer layer. Agent of the structure shown in Fig.
ARMS Agent in functional layer 3 as follows.
. • communication layer is responsible for communication with other Agent Agent, the
information is  divided into three  types: 1 >  Advertising ( Advertisement), a  new  Agent



Aqent structure of FIG 6 Arms
When the hierarchy, i ts  use  of  advertising information She Agent  announce their presence; 2 ) exploration ( Discovery), information is requested to explore the resources of distributed applications; 3 ) forwards ( To another agent), and i t has i t self when Agent know when the parent node, child node can not satisfy a request, i t will forward  the  request  to  their adjacent nodes, by the neighboring nodes continue to  look  for  the  right  resources. A -  gent or when a  neighboring node was found to  meet  hi s  request, the  request will be  forwarded to the node from the neighboring node to complete the work allocated resources.
Collaborative layers: a core structure of Agent, Agent using the ACT ( Agent Capability Table) to maintain i tself, the performance of th e information resources of parent and child nodes Agent Agent represented. ACT can be divided into four categories: 1 ) T_ ACT,  to maintain their own information; 2 ) L_ ACT, the child node  is  used  to  maintain information  on Agent; 3 ) G_ ACT, the parent node i s used to maintain information on Agent; 4 ) C " ACT,  used to maintain cache Agent information.
Scheduler to schedule tasks by estimating the end t ime of the request, the purpose of scheduling is to f ind a minimum of the end t ime. The end t ime of T -  =  exet- Yts, exet request  is an estimated execution t ime, ^ is the t ime of the request started. PACE ( Performance Analysis and Characterize Environment) engine can be estimated ep " ARMS application contains a request application model ( ap at the request of the situ ation and application of local resourcesplication model, am), an end t ime estimated by PACE to the eval function is defined inside the associated previous request. Agent estimated order to  f ight the  use  of  ACT is: C_ ACT, T_ ACT, L_ ACT, G_ ACT. The estimat ion result,  f ind the minimum corresponding to ACT. If T_ ACT, Match Maker transmits the scheduling result to the local management, local resource allocation. Otherwise, i t forwards the request to the ACT corresponding Agent. I f you do not meet the condition s  of  ACT, forwarded to  their parent  and child nodes will be requested to continue the process of  f inding  the  above  by  the parent and child nodes, until the ACT meet the conditions found.
Local Management: Responsible for monitoring of local resources, allo cate and manage applications, is the interface layer and a local Agent underlying system.
Distributed scheduling resource management system applied to  the  load  is  larger, making the specified dispersed into the respective different nodes in parallel, so th at the system can still quickly re- scheduling of resources under  heavy  load. In  a  small  system load, a node to make scheduling needs to communicate with multiple nodes, but this reduces the efficiency of decision- making and reduce the scalability of the sy stem.

8Status Scalability Testing
--

Testing and verification is the basis of  evaluation  of  scalability.  Scalability  can  be tested in two main ways: 1 ) the test code level. By performing the test a plurality of sets of different conditions, and the evaluatio n code blocks in each  test  program  in  response  to the correlation coefficient of the total t ime. Comparative tests in all groups the code block correlation coefficients, to measure the degree of parallelism of the code  block.  By  the degree of parallelism of each code block scalability assessment procedures. 2 ) system level test. System- level testing by estimating the work load, real - t ime monitoring of test  runs  and test run results to comprehensively evaluate the program scalability.
In most studies, scalability, just as a test of performance  indicators,  for  scalability current testing methods and systems more l imited study i tself. The  following describes a  code level, respectively, and a system - level test method scalability.

8.1Test parallel code Scalability
--

Parallel scalability of the code can be obtained by analyzing the performance of each code block: block parallelism as possible,   a  small  increase   in  processor   instructions  can protect Parallel efficiency program; otherwise, need to  add  more  processors  to  maintain the efficiency of the program. Testers often modeling approach to  analyze the  performance  of the system or program, system and application depending on the  composition  and structure of internal model modules constructed interrelationships system performance analysis.
Because of the logical relationship between the structures and components internal parallel computing systems are complex, difficult and expensive modeling, and difficult to guarantee the correctness of the model. To this end,  Gordon  Lyon  [ 24 ]  Chu  mention  the DEX ( statistically designed experiment) method, the test of DEX parallel programs and the system as a complete whole experiment, the various parameters of the system considered snippet and each factorial experiments . Based on the operation result of the program, by monitoring performance metrics for each parallel program code modules, using statistical methods to analyze the impact of each block of code in the  program run  t ime, each code  block obtained degree of importance of the efficiency of  the  algorithm. DEX introduced the SP ( synthetic perturbation), for applying respective test disturbance factors, for the manufacture of these perturbations delay system is running, the experiment used  to  build  the mapping factor experimental  results. When a  factor /  is  applied perturbation can cause  a delay of the disturbance analysis to measure / degree of influence  on  the  system  or running.
DEX parallel program for the purpose of a test of P, P identify code blocks may be run bottleneck. DEX, the experiment in group units. In the same set of experiments, the various factors of the system remains unchanged, and for each code block in the  disturbance continues to change,  by perturbation analysis  of this  group  of  experiments   and procedures The relationship between the running t ime, come running t ime of the sensitivity of each code A large block, when the t ime delay is applied to the same length of the disturbance, resulting in the greater run t ime delay. Followed by another group of experiments, the system change factor ( typically the number of processors), in case of increase or decrease the number of processors, the value of £ reanalyzed each code  block.  The f inal possibility, the same block comparison value £ both experiments, was observed in  the case of increased processor £ growth rate, the  greater  the  increase  £  module,   indicating that the block parallelism worse, become the bottleneck of the Big. If
£ processor increases with decreases, then the  degree  of  parallelism  is  preferably  block, the smaller becomes the bottleneck possibilities.

8.2Scalability Test System Design
-

Scalability reflects the ability of the system may vary depending on system needs and resources change, continue to meet performance requirements.  Scalability  test  systems need to focus on changing the relationship  between  system  requirements  and  resources and system performance, so the scalability test system can  be  divided  into  the  following four modules.	-
1)Workload Analysis Module: for real - t ime capture and analysis of dynamic workloads.
2)Resource performance analysis module: for real - t ime analysis of the changing performance of the underlying resources.
3)System  performance  monitoring  module:  used  to  capture  performance  data  at  run t ime, for further analysis.
4)Scalability Analysis Module: The f i rst three modules data captured in real t ime to analyze the scalability of the system.
STASCScalability Testing and System Analysis) [ 23 ] a - a typical system- level testing system scalability, which consists of four parts: the system wherein component analysis algorithm pre- assembly, assembly and test scalability  analysis  scalability  components.  STAS is  characterized  by  i ts  combination  of  workload  algorithms  and  f inal test  response t ime, combined with the load and the resour ces to make an assessment of scalability. Meanwhile STAS also supports testers definition of scalability testing methods since. STAS structure shown in Fig.


A configuration diagram of FIG. 7 STAS
Wherein the system components: Its mission is to obtain information on the underlying system, and measure the performance of each node is calculated. It is divided into two modules: a system information detection module and node performance measurement module. The system information detection module detection s ystem of each node, or nodes from deduplication unavailable, leaving only active nodes. For activities Node, Node performance  measurement  module  to  measure   the  performance  of   the   node   by   a user- defined bench- mark. The f inal output of this module is a set o f tuples: < node name, property>.
Pre- analysis algorithm module: i t analyzes the source code of the distributed algorithm as input, workload  output f i les, and executable algorithm.  The  work  load  analysis algorithm can be done at the same t ime compiler,  you  can  also  employ  user- defined analysis mode. User to measure the load artificially algorithm specified by the equation between the input data and the workload.

Scalability test components: i t is responsible for runtime scalability test systems and algorithms in the manner defined by testers. It  consists of  three modules: the  test  module set is generated, real - t ime measurement module and a database module.

Saas CSoftware as a Service) model  is  based  on  the  new  software application software to provide Internet services, Saas provide users with a complete software, users can  access  the service via the Internet, only in accordance with their needs to  the  rental  service provider, eliminating the need for purchase hardware, software development and ongoing maintenance costs. Cloud computing is parallel computing and distributed  computing   concept development, which provides a  reliable infrastructure for Saas.  The  cloud is  a ble   to self- manage and maintain a collection of virtual computing resources.  Cloud  computing has the following characteristics: 1 ) scalability, the size  of  the  cloud  can  dynamically  expand and contract to meet the changing needs of users; 2 ) pay - as, users can own actual consumption of cloud resources to buy paid; 3 ) very large scale,  the  scale  of  cloud  computing in general  has reached more than hundreds  of thousands  of servers;  4 )  persistent, cloud computing system can provide long - lasting computing resources and capabilities for the user. These Unlike traditional distributed and parallel  computing  features, metrics on scalability for cloud computing, design and testing to bring new and challenging issues.

9.1Cloud computing scalability of the problem
--

Cloud scalability is not only the traditional focus on scalability, but also emphasize the contraction of the cloud. One of i ts important features namely pay - on- demand, allowing multiple cloud tenants in a shared cloud computing resources can save costs as much as possible. This requires the user' s application workloads in a small t ime, be  able to  reduce  the consumption of resources  applications, while reducing resource consumption can maintain the performance of applications, to meet the needs of users. Scalabi l i ty more traditional focus on behalf of the " extended" scalability,  in  the   case  of  computing  resources increase, the growth rate of a certain measure of performance indicators. In contrast, cloud computing is also concerned about the " shrinking" in this r egard, namely to reduce the workload, application performance can still get  the  case to  meet the  cloud can  be recovered resources, improve resource utilization, reduce the ability of the user fee. Measure shrinkage of cloud computing include not  only  a  mea sure  of  resource  growth brings increased performance, but also include measures to  enhance  the  degree  of  reduction of resource utilization metrics and user fees when the load decreases.

9.2Cloud computing scalability design issues
--

Cloud computing large scale features make the same number of resources in a cloud

computing platform becomes very large, the performance requirements of the Resource Management System is also higher. In the center scheduling and distributed  scheduling modes, when the scale of the cloud, the central dispatcher scheduler will become the bottleneck of the system. Accordingly, the cloud is more suitable for distributed scheduling paradigm. The distributed scheduling  the decision - making distributed to each node, reducing the probabilit y of occurrence of a bottleneck. At the same t ime created a new problem: resource allocation is carried out through communication and collaboration  between the different nodes of the multi - party collaborative  decision- making  model  is more complex than the type of decision- making center.
In a distributed scheduling, multi - party collaborative decision- making model design requires attention to the following questions.
Heterogeneity between nodes: the ultra - large- scale cloud computing system, there will be different structure of resource nodes. When  scheduling  the  nodes  of  these  isomers, these isomers can not directly operate nodes need to design an  abstract resource node to  mask the differences between the different nodes, the upper operation only acts in the abstract resource node.
Between node communication protocol design issues: agreement between the node defines the format and exchange of  information, and  the  information exchanged  between the nodes constitute the basis for scheduling algorithms to make deci sions. In the  design of the protocol, the protocol needs to take into account the accuracy and completeness of the problem. To ensure the accuracy of the information exchange between nodes i s error - free, and to ensure the completeness of the agreement can cover all possible scenarios of the exchange of information between the nodes to avoid because of lack of Less of a Treatments scene and error.

9.3Cloud computing scalability testing issues
--

Test as a measure of system scalability based on the test system should be  designed for the characteristics of the  test system. Cloud computing scalability test system should have the ability to solve the following problems: 1 ) the ability to monitor real - t ime, cloud computing has the characteristics of durability, but also can not be accurately estimated workload, resource performance at the moment, so i t is necessary to test the system can capture real- t ime data, comprehensive application performance metrics  to  analyze  the cloud computing platform scalability; ability 2 ) two- way test, as opposed to the traditional distributed computing only focus on capacity  expansion,  the  test  should  be  concerned about the same t ime, " stretch" and " shrink" both to analyze  scalability  or  contractible under different scenarios. When incr easing the applied load, as measured by the number of new scalability of resource allocation and use of l i ft; when the load decreases, is  calculated by the number of resource consumption reduction measure shrinkage properties.
Conclusion Scalability as an important attribute of the cloud, with the development of cloud computing and Saas, which has become a hot issue ® f of study. Scalability definitions and metrics will also vary with the different scenarios. In the context of cloud computing, scalability research focus will be to define and measure the scalability when resources are shrinking, heterogeneous cloud resource allocation   and  resource  nodes  in   real - t ime  two- way scalability measurements.

10.Improved Byzantine consensus research

10.1POINTNITY proposed extended definition of validity attributes
--

Structurally, i t is composed of two parts.
•The f i rst component is reduced to a binary multi - value consensus consensus.
Reduced, which is fully synchronized, neither randomized nor  is  the  ultimate leader, the re is no signature. To our knowledge, this is the f i rst asynchronous reducing unscheduled
always  determine the  value 0 ( 1 )  binary consensus sequence. The  earliest examples of
reducing wait before terminating only reliable broadcast concurrent instances of spawning binary consensus. Because i t is assumed that t < N / 3 ,  where n  is  the number of  processes and t is the number of errors during the upper bound, this reduction is best toughness.
•The second component is a binary Byzantine consensus ( BBC) algorithm, neither
randomized nor the last leader, there is no signature. It is broadcast on the appropriate binary value ( BV- broadcast) abstraction, for introducing randomization consensus.
Calculated from a point of view, the BBC algorithm requires t < N / 3  ( as  previous reduction) and additional synchronization hypothesis, i . e., a t ime after which transmitting a message
transmitted by the non - defective by the process delay constants sector ( this happens, but neither the t ime, nor is i t a constant process known own. in  practice, this means that the  BBC algorithm always terminate unless the transmission delay is always increased ( in this case, different assumptions synchronization as described may be used).
The resulting multivalued Byzantine algorithm is op t imal consistency and toughness ( T
< N / 3 ), and the best t ime, since i t terminates at 0 ( t) is. In addition to i ts optimal
characteristics and the concept is simple, multi - value obtained by the Byzantine consensus algorithm is well suited for the consortiu m blockchains three following reasons:
The algorithm does not use leaders elected ( in favor of the value proposed by a
particular process), or proven to work - which means that the consensus of each participant plays a role equal to the value proposed. In particular, because i t does not depend on the
verification of work choice, because more than any other t ime in Bitcoin t icket or revenge, node consortium could not reach a  consensus. We  have noticed that  in  June 2016 Revenge  of R 3 R 3 50 machines consortium in a machine owned by a consortium of revenge
blockchain total mining capacity, which gives a significant advantage of this machine to attack 12 % blockchain of.
The algorithm is to indulge in, i t is  always safe despite any  delays. We  believe this is  an important characteristic of every day, one million $ US trade volume blockchain
applications 1 Financial institutions may prefer their blockchain service is not available,
rather than undermine, after the Internet communication delay congestion impact. This is usually used as test bed consortium R 3 , wherein attacker can decide to use the network
delay Revenge algorithm block contrast double spending two conflicting.
Finally, because we focus on the consorti um blockchain model in  which the  consensus of participants is l imited to members of the consortium, we can assume the identity of n
consortium members are known by all participants. Usually only a subset of all the
participants involved in the consensus bl ockchain, for example, only the consensus N = 15  out of 50 treated R 3 is participating. These provide us with the identification of Sybil
attack algorithm a natural protection without the need for any expensive verification mechanism.
Roadmap sheet 7 const i tuting part. Computational model described in Section 2 .
Section 3 describes the Blockchain Byzantine consensus. Section 4 , in binary Byzantine agreement, reducing the multivalued Byzantine agreement, Section 5 presents the f inal synchronization relies on a  binary hypothesis Byzantine agreement. The composition of
these two algorithms provide free leader, no signature, no randomized and multi - valued

Byzantine consensus. Section 6 describes related work. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

2.22Reliable broadcast
This abstract definition of broadcasting ( in short, RB - broadcast) proposed by G. of Bracha. It is a single- trigger pair abstract all communications, which provides two
processing operations and represents RB_ broadcast RB_ delive r. When the PI call operation RB_ broadcast ( respectively, RB_ deliver), we say that i t " RBbroadcasts 〃 message
( respectively," RB- provide 〃 news). A broadcast RB- e. g., when the process
px is the sender, defined by the following properties.
RB- effectiveness. If a non- faulty process from the non- fault- pixel processing, and provide RB- meters PX RB- broadcast message m.
RB- Unicity. A non- faulty process RB- provide a message from a pixel at most.

RB- termination 1 . If there is no defect and RB - PX broadcast message m, all non- faulty process from the f inal
PX RB- provide meters
RB- termination - 2 . If a non- faulty process RB- PX  message delivered from the m  ( may be faulty), all non- faulty process ultimately provides the same message m from PXRB - .
Output RB- validity attribute refers to the input terminal, and  RB -  unity indicates that no duplicate message. Event of termination statements that the process must RB - deliver
the message. Their second is what makes broadcast and  reliable. It  was  shown in  a  t  < N  /  3 is the upper l imit for T, when performing such an abstraction has.
Let' s  remark, i t  is  possible that the value can be  delivered by  non - fault RB-  process,
but i t is actually a Byzantine and the sender has not invoked RB_ broadcast. This is possible,  for example when the sender Byzantine network level, in which several messages sent to
different subsets of the playback process occurs, and executes a predicate RB - RB-
transport algorithm is abstract broadcast messages in a f inal satisfaction. When this
happens, by abuse of language, we say that the sender of the call RB - broadcast. This is achieved by the fact that, in this case, the non - faulty i f the sender i s not the process can  not distinguish between a fault or motivation.

In this paper, we consider a general ization of the classic Byzantine consistency, the
introduction informally. Because of i ts effectiveness requirements excited by blockchain,

VPBC termination. The value of a f inal decision on each non - faulty process. VPBC- agreement. Two non- fault decision process is not different values.
VPBC- effectiveness. Value determination is effective, i t is effective to meet the expressed predefined predicates.
The classic definition of this definition Byzantine general consensus, excluding the
predicate effective. As an example, in  a  collision fault model, any  proposed value is  valid.  In the Byzantine basic consensus, any suggestion s values are valid unless all non

The algorithm of the reduced multivalued binary Byzantine Byzantine consensus consensus is described in this algorithm, a procedure call operation mv_ propose ( V),

•Stage 1 : PI propagation value ( l ines 01 and 11 ). A method by calling the f i rst PI RB - broadcast operation ( wire 01 ) which processes the transmission of all values. When a
transfer process RB- a value of  PJ  v RB- broadcast technology, i t  is  stored in  proposalsi [ j]  i f v is valid.
•Phase 2 : PI has been involved a f i rst set of binary consensus instances ( l ines 02 - 04 ) is. Then, the PI enters a loop where i t began to participate binary consensus Examples
BIN_ CONS [ K], i t is proposed 1 , each process from PKRB - having associated delivery suggested value ( l ines 02 - 03 ). Examples of pi found consensus binary BIN - CONS [ ' ] ,
wherein 1 is determined ( l ine 04 ) to stop the cycle. Stage ( 2 ) arriving after the ( binary consensus of our proposed after allowing only O ( 1 ) delay the end of the message.
•Stage 3 : PI began to participate in all other binary consensus instance s ( l ines 05 - 06 ).
It knows a binary instance of consensus decision after 1 , PI call in all instances i t  has  not been involved in binary consensus BIN - CONS [ K] bin_ propose ( 0 ) . We note that this is
possible, some examples of BIN- CONS [ k], and no process has the process associated with a value PKRB-. The purpose of these common shares is to ensure that all binary consensus,
the f inal termination.
•Stage 4 : Determined value for pi ( l ines 07 - 10 and 12 ).
Finally PI consensus that successful binary objects, i . e., the f i rst ( according to the
process sequence index), i . e., those that returns 1 ( l ine 08 ) is. 3 Let BIN_ CONS [ J] is such a consensus binary objects. Since the decision value of 1 is associated, at least one non - fault proposed procedure shown in FIG. 1 , whi ch means that  the  process values  from the PK  l ine 02 - 03 ) RBdelivered of. We observed that, due to the termination of - 2 RB- property, the
value of each process i s f inal RB- delivered without defects. Thus, PI  decided that  ( l ines 09 - 10 ).

10.4.2Correctness prove

Lemma 1 Yes determine the value of at least 1 case of a binary consensus of all non- fault process exit repeat the cycle.
From the operational point of  view, this lemma can be restated as  follows: At  least one     ' e [ i . . N] so that each non- faulty process P 1 , we end up with bin_ decisionsi [ ' ] = 1 .
Evidence is contradictory. Let us assume that, in the process of any non - fault P 1 , no bin_ decisionsi [ ' ] , 1 <' < N, 1 is set to continue. Thus, there is no non - faulty process exits
" 〃 repeated loop ( l ine 0204 ). As a non- valid value when the fault occurred PJRB -

RB- PJ' s proposal to provide effective, so we end up with proposals! [ j] = 6 in each non - PI Shang treatment failure.
It follows the f i rst sub - predicate from l ine 02 of all non- fault handling Pi call

termination, BBC- agreement, BBC- effectiveness, and intrusion Tolerance, which

2Lemma 1

returns values for all BBC process instance to a non - fault, wherein the outlet " 〃 cycle is

repeated.
Lemma 2 Determination value is a valid value ( i . e., i t is effective to satisfy the predicate).
We f i rst prove that observed for a value proposalsi [ J] is determin ed by the circumference of a process, we need bin_ decisionsi [ J] = 1 ( l ines 08 - 10 ).
If  the value is 1  when BIN_ CONS [ j], bin_ decisionsi [ j]  =  1  is  a  processing decision PI ( l ine 12 ) in each non- fault f inal true. If only one example proposed a BBC, and ( i i )

of . bin_ propose ( 1 ) 6 = Shang. Since the l ine 11 , i t follows proposalsi [ j] contains a valid value.
Lemma 3 Two non- fault decision process is not different values.
Let us  consider two prove any non troubleshooting Pi and PJ,  so  Pi  decided  proposalsi  [ K] and PJ decided to proposals 〗 [ K2 ] . It follows from l ine 08 is K1 = min { x satisfies
bin_ decisionsi [ X] = 1 } and k2 = MIN { x satisfies bin_ decisionsj [ X] = 1 }.
Ontheonehand, i tfollows even omline07 that ( V 1 < x < nbin_ decisionsj [ X] 6 = Shang), from which we conclude that both pi and PJ known binary values determined by each
instance of binary Consensus ( l ine 12 ). Due to the properties of each binary consensus agreement BBC- instance, we have Vx: bin_ decisionsi [ X] = bin_ decisionsj [ X].
Let decanoate [ X] = in_ decisionsi [ X] = bin_ decisionsj [ X]. From l ine 08 i t is K1 = K2 = min { x dec satisfy [ X] = 1 } = K then follows. Thus, decyl [ K] = 1 .
On the other hand, i t i s derived from a non - faulty process p BIN_ CONS [ k] intrusion resistant properties' call BIN_ CONS [ K] . bin_ propose ( 1 ). Line 03 may be sent as the only
call, we conclude that ( predicate from l ine 02 ), the proposals' [ K] = V 6 = Shang. As p ' is no failure, and i t follows from the RB - RB- terminated - 2 unity for all non- fault handling
characteristics supplied from PK RB- v. Thus, we end up with proposalsi [ K] = proposals 〗
[ K], which concludes the proof of Lemma.
Lemma 4 The value of each non- fault handling decision.
It follows from the proof of Lemma 1 , there are some PJ allows us to f inally h ave
bin_ decisionsi [ J] = 1 in the process of all non - fault and non- fault does not always online processing block 04 . Therefore, all non - fault process calls each binary consensus instance

This section describes the underlying binary consistency Byzantine algorithm BBC,
which provides a process operation bin_ propose. The advantage of  this algorithm is  that  i t  is guaranteed to terminate, i f all non - faulty process made the same value, i f not
synchronized and always in a constant number of message delays. The algorithm may
terminate within a f ixed t ime, this is the case, e. g. , i f all non- fault handling proposed by the same value. The algorithm relies on all communication to all binary abstract

section. The algorithm gradually established. We f i rst present a simple algorithm, only to meet consensus safety performance ( BBC - effectiveness and BBC- protocol). The algorithm

is then synchronized with the f inal extension to meet the consensus assumptions active property ( BBC- termination). The purpose of this gradual approach i s for ease of
understanding and proof.

Broadcast binary value ( BV- broadcast) communication abstraction in already incorporated ( which is implemented in the Appendix A review).
Broadcast to all is defined BV- abstract all communications, i t provides a method
BV_ broadcast represented by a single operation. When a process calls BV_ broadcast TAG ( m), we say that i t " BVbroadcasts message TAG ( meters)." Content of the message m is 0 or 1

In a broadcast BV- e. g., each binary value of the non - faulty process PI BV- broadcast,

represented as bin_ valuesi. This set, is initialized to 0 , add new values received. BV- broadcast defined by the following four properties.
BV- obligations. If at least ( T + 1 ) during non - fault BV- same broadcast value v, v is added to the f inal set of non- defective bin_ valuesi each process pi.
BV- reasons. If no fault is pi and v G bin_ valuesi, V hexyl BV - broadcast via a non- fault process.
BV- uniform. If  the value of  v  is  added to  the process P 1  is set no  fault bin_ valuesi,  f inal v G bin_ valuesj PJ in each process without defects.
BV- terminated. Finally, each non- fault process pi bin_ valuesi collection is not empty.
Play a BV- Properties The following properties are a direct consequence of the previous characte r. Finally, the non - faulty processing set bin_ valuesi PKO becomes non- empty, ( i i ) becomes equal, ( i i i ) contains all values processed by the non- fault
broadcast, and ( iv) does not contain a Byzantine process only by the broadcast value . However, ( i i ) and ( i i i ) does not occur when the process known non- defective.

•Phase 1 : The current estimate ( l ines 03 - 05 ) coordinated the exchange.
PI  process f i rst  proceeds to  the next round, and BV -  broadcast i ts current estimate  ( l ine 04 ). After, PI wait until i t sets bin_ valuesi [ R] is not empty ( let us recall that when bin_ valuesi [ R] is not empty, i t is not necessarily i ts f inal value).
•Phase 2 : Estimated second exchange in favor of convergence ( l ines 06 - 07 ).
In this second stage, the PI broadcast ( Thus, this i s neither a nor RB- BV- broadcast
broadcast) message AUX [ R] ( the content of which is bin_ valuesi [ R] ( l ine 06 ). Then, the PI wait until i t receives a set of values that satisfy the following two properties valuesi.
- valuesi £ bin_ valuesi [ R]. Thanks BV - reason attributes, which ensures ( even Byzantine AUX false message transmission process [ R & l t] () contains only the values proposed by the Byzantine process) valuesi comprising a non - fault handling only by the broadcast values.
Different processes - ( t N) - the value of at least valuesi messages from AUX [ R] ().
Thus, in any round R, l ine 07 , valuesi £ { 0 , 1 } and broadcast only the value of a non- fault comprises BV- process l ine 04 .
•Stage 3 : Try to decide ( l ines 08 - 12 ).
This stage is a purely local computing stage, during which ( i f  not  yet  complete) trying to determine the PI value b = R 2 mode ( l ine 08 and 10 ), which depends on the content of valuesi.
-If the element contains a single valuesi v  ( l ine 09 ),  then v  becomes the new  estimate of the PI.  In  addition, v  is  a  candidate decision. In  order to  ensure BBC -  agreement, V  can be determined only i f  V  =  B.  This decision is  determined by  the statement implemented ( V)  ( l ine 10 ).
-If  valuesi =  { 0 , 1 },  and PI can not be  determined. Since these two values   already
proposed by the non- fault process, cause such convergence protocol, selecting one of them the PI ( b, i . e., the same procedure in all non - fault) as a new estimated value ( l ine 11 ).
Let us observe the decision ( f ive) PI does not terminate the call t o participate in the algorithm of pi, namely PI continue the endless cycle continues. The randomization
algorithm may use the techniques presented to  termination. Instead, we  keep  i t  simple and to postpone this algorithm in Section 5 . 5 of uncertainty termi nal solutions.

PI process is a non- fault process, so valuesri predicate satisfied by l ine 07 . In addition, the set of values valuesi, let us recall that in a given operation, C represents a non - fault

Lemma 5 provided T < N / 3 . If at the  beginning of  a  round r,  all non - fault process has the same estimate V, after which they never change their valuation.
We assume that all non- faulty proof treatment ( which at least N - T> T + 1 ) have the same when they begin estimating v Accordingly a river, they broadcast the same message BV- EST [ R] ( v) in a l ine 04 i t is the duty BV - BV- reasons and properties, each non- faulty process pi is derived bin_ valuesi [ R] = { V} in l ine 05 ,
Thus i t may broadcast only AUX [ R] 06 .  consid er  any  non- fault handling PI ({ v}) in the  l ine, then i t follows ( valuesi only comprises v) from l ine 07 predicate, l ine 09 ( valuesi a

Lemma 6 ■ provided T < N / 3 . ( PI, PJGC) A ( valu esri = { V}) A ( Value: BU ( - )) demonstrate this: PI is provided a fault - free process, such valuesri = { V}. It follows the same PI message received AUX [ R] ({ V}) from the l ine 07 -- different processes ( N t ), i . e., from at least ( N - 2 T) different non- fault handling. The n - 2 t in d + 1 ,  which means that the PI  message received  AUX [ R] ({ V}) from at least ( T + 1 ) of different non - homogeneous set of process failure.
PJ  is  so  fault- free process, such valuesrj =  { w}. ( -  TN) different treatment. Thus,  PJ

Then, the predicate i t from l ine 07 ( i ) as fol lows ( values 1 i £ bin_ valuesi), and abstract BVJustification BV- broadcast attributes, such that each set of non - defective values 1 i process contains only non- defective by the recommendation process values. Thus, ESTI distribution ( either in  l ine 10 or 11 ) provided by the value presented by the non - faulty process. The same principle
applies to two R = 2 , R = 3 , etc., these results prove the lemma.

Lemma 8 .  provided T  < N  /  3 .  Two  non - fault decision process is  not different values.
Let  R  be  a  f i rst  round proved, during which no  fault decision process, so  that PI  is a

If another non- fault decision process during oxygen PJ wheel, we have valuesrj = { W}, and since Lemma 6 , we have W = # Thus, all decisions in a non - fault handling stainless

Let PJ is not a f law, i t  is  not decided in  a  stainless steel prices. As  valuesri =  { V}, and PJ  is not a value determined stainless steel, i t i s not always the next Lemma 6 there valuesrj =

Thus, all non- faulty estimation process begins with the same local v wheel ( R + 1 ) =

10.5.4Eventual synchronization hypothesis
--

Consensus impossibility ^ It is well known, there is no consensus algorithm to  ensure the safety and fully asynchronous messaging system activity, which, even i n a single
process may crash. Since the collapse of the fault model is less serious than the Byzantine model fails, the process can not reach a consensus, i f possible, make Byzantine fault is still  the case.
In order to avoid such a possibility, and to  ensure consistent termination properties,  the model must be rich with additional computing powe r. Examples of  such power may  be set in the input vectors, randomized, or synchronization failure detector is provided with assumed constraints. As the announcem ent date, we here consider the method of
synchronization based on additional assumptions.
After additional synchronization is assumed in the  following, assume that a  f inite t ime T, the transmission delay of packets 5 of an upper l imit. This assumption is a 3 Synch
( eventual synchrony hypothesis). To take advantage of i t by using a t imer, we also assume

that the process can be accurately measured intervals, although they do not need to have synchronized clocks.

Description Extended algorithm describes the following i tems appear in Figure 3 of the new and revised statements.
•the l ine NEW 1 , PI calculating the current wheel coordinator, and set i ts local t imer, which is used in the predicate of the expiration l in e M- 05 . The t imeout value is initialized before entering the loop, then rose in every round.
•NEW 3 l ine is a t imer that expires for resetting a simple l ine in the modified M - 07 predicate.
Line NEW 2 , NEW 4 , M- 06 , and New 5 implement a mechanism that allows t he current round of coordination, trying to impose a value of 6 into the f i rst judgment of i ts value
bin_ values set. The fact that, after the presence of a t ime, by a non - fault message exchange process is t imely, i t will have to ensure that the wheel dur ing this period, the non- faulty
process will have a single value in their valuesi sleeve ( which binds - 10 required by the lemma their decision).
•modified l ines of the M- 05 and M- 07 : In addition to the predicate in the corresponding l ine considered in t i mer expires.
As just seen, the idea to start the operation of these new or revised statement is:
caused such a decision from the overall coordination of the interests of a defect - free, by
requiring the process, so that all non - fault process uses i t to play a recommended value. to this end:
Circular coordinate PK broadcast message COORD_ VALUE [ RI] ( W), wherein w is set into i ts bin_ values ( l ine NEW 2 ) the f i rst value. If PK is no fault, the fault - free process
t imeout value is large enough, and the message t ransmission delay binding, all non- faulty process will receive the l ine M - 06 before the t imer expires.
•Then, assuming that the previous i tem, is set to Wa Laid AUXI ( l ine NEW 4 )} all non- fault handling, and broadcasts i t ( l ine M - 06 ). W predicate Gbin_ valuesi [ RI] for preventing Byzantine coordinator sends the tank during the non - faulty false.
•Finally, all non- faulty process will receive the message AUX [ RI] ({ W}) from a -
different processes ( N t), and set by l ine New 5 valuesi = { w}. This circle ( R 1 ) or mean that their decision ( R + 2 ) period.
From asynchronous to synchronous decision - making in order to ensure the f inal
synchronization hypothesis, and after each trouble - free processing t ime- out value is large enough ( that is, than the upper bound messagin g big delay), we need to  eventually perform  all non- synchronized troubleshooting Round . It observed that, since the initial
asynchronous, non- fault on the consensus algorithm can process at different t imes. In addition, due to the potential participants B yzantine process, a number of non- faulty process can be ahead of two, without decisions, and other trouble - free process i s still
executing the previous rounds. By using a long process t imes out all round, and ultimately achieve synchronous behavior from th eir circle.
Lemma 12 . We consider the algorithm of Figure 3 will ultimately no faults in the process of synchronization round from their behavio r.
3 Synch f inal proofing has an unknown message transmission delay constraint 5 . As
noted in Section 2 , assuming local processing t ime is equal to zero. ( Or, in  Appendix B  and C  do not depend on this assumption is provided with two additional evidence). Hereinafter,
description will be  given in  t ime units of  integers. Subscripts ( e. g.  tfirst O)  will be  used to
indicate the sign of t is elapsed since the beginning of the algorithm has, as a  whole so  that  the global number of viewer G. known from the measured t ime unit measuring a given t ime period at least as  observed the  rate  of  non - fault processes and events can  occu r  at  integer t ime unit.
We will use the following definitions:
tfirstr as measured by  a  G  in the f i rst t ime of  non - failure process pfirst arrival circle R   ( tfirst O t ime, when the f i rst non - consensus start troubleshooting).
t lastr is the last non- faulty process PLAST arrival circle R ( t last O is the t ime when the

last non- consensus start troubleshooting) as the t ime measured by the G.
For a circle is synchronous, all non - fault process must have enough t ime to get all the news that a t imeout before any due pro cess trouble- free broadcast of trouble- free process that round. In this case, the last non - fault is processed in turn reaches the coordinator,
which may take up to COORD_ VALUE [ R] 3 before the message is received by all the
non- faulty delay to  process mess ages  ( including messages delayed until up  to  2  a  value into i ts bin_ values [ r] and the further delayed broadcast message COORD_ VALUE [ R]). Therefore, we must have a round where r t lastr + 5 < tfirstr + t imeout r.
It  should be  noted that taking into account  the t ime- out  from 0 0  round, each by  one
round of growth, we can replace the R t imeoutr consider any round of the f i rst round of the river which t imeoutr O ^ R 0 meet. For any round in which R 00 R 00 plastr OO 2 R 0 maximum
amount of t ime to complete the round will be 2 xtimeoutr00 . This is due to the fact, f inally trouble- free process circle arrival will not have to wait to receive more than 5 longer in
order to  meet the information on  the l ine M - 05  and M- 07  to  the required conditions, in
order to take t ime to p erform the wheel will no more than two t imeout length
polymorphism. All other non- fault process takes at least 2 xtimeoutr 00 complete circle R 00.
From a certain round in which R 00 process last no defect in t ime can be written as:

When the f i rst t ime the process reaches a circle without defects R 00 is:

1 block to the results of this inequality points:

Remove the equal components, we have:
t lastr O + 3 x52 tons a desk / ^ 0 + R 00 .
Therefore, through a circular R 00 = t lastr O + 3 x5 - tfirstr O synchronization is guaranteed.
Now will show that once inequality ( 1 ) satisfies an R 00 ( which t imeoutr00 > 5 ), i t will remain satisfactory in all of the following rounds. Consider wheel R 00 + 1 , in view of
inequality ( 1 ) Established in round R 00 ,  we have: t lastr00 + 3 x5 < tfirstr00 + t imeoutr00 . ( 2 )
And i t needs to prove the following inequality is true:
Father t lastr00 + 1 + 3 5 < t | a / A00 + 1 + overtime / ^ 00 + 1 ( 3 )
Using the same parameters as  the above process of  the f i rst  and last t imes wherein  R 00 + 1 reaches the wheel has:
t lastr00 + 1 = t lastr00 + 2 xtimeoutr00 and tfirstr00 + 1 > tfirstr00 + 2 xtimeoutr00 . This clogging of the inequality ( 3 ) results in:
t lastr00 + 2 xtimeoutr00 + 3 x5 < tfirstr00 + 2 xtimeoutr00 + t imeoutr00 + 1 . Aliquots result in:
t lastr00 + 3 x5 < tfirstr00 + t imeoutr00 + 1 .
This inequality, which is equivalent to Inequality ( 3 ) having the same components, the inequality ( 2 ), except that instead of having t imeoutr00 + 1 t imeoutr00 . Thus, Inequality ( 3 ) must be satisfied, because the ineq uality ( 2 ) i s satisfied. This is summed up by any one of
R 00 after real. 5 . 6 Proof 3 Synch 2 Lemma 12 based algorithm
The certificate consists of two parts :( a) show, add statements consistent security

Lemma 13 . Validity and satisfaction algorithm BBC - BBC- protocol properties as described in FIG.
Proof to prove the lemma proof comprising 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 , maintain the correct, these
proofs 3 substantially remains the a lgorithm takes into account FIG correct because, as the

new and modified assignment statement does not set bin_ valuesi [ R] in the non - fault
handling, and with a characteristic not bin_ valuesi t iming hypothesis, non - faulty process can not contain only by the PI process Byzantine recommended value setting spoon
bin_ valuesi [ R]. It follows from this observation, the non - faulty at any
Li ( l ine M- 07 , New5 , 10 or 11 , defined or updated) and local variables from valuesi ESTI can contain only non- faulty process values. More specifically, we have the following.
•Lemma 5 . Let R be a circle under consideration, and v is no process failure of current estimates. Then, we have bin_ valuesi [ R] = { V} M - 05 l ine of each non- fault process pi. - If
the fault- free round coordination PK, we each non- fault occurred AUXI = bin_ valuesi [ R] =
{ V}. It follows then valuesri = { V} and lemma since the l ine 09 and 10 hold true.
- If the coordinate PK Byzantine circle and different values may be sent to non- fault
process, let us consider the received message COORD_ VALUE [ R] non - fault handling ({ 1 - V}). (1	- v) of G / bin_ valuesi [ R], online NEW 4 , PI performed " else" portion, where i t is
provided to AUXI { V} ( bin_ valuesi unique value in [ R & l t]), and the following lemma.
•Lemma 6 , since i t does not rely on a t imer, and relates only to the fact that valuesri each group and the two non - fault process valuesrj single, still prove effective.
•Lemma 7 . proof of the fact that following collection bin_ valuesi any non - fault process of troubleshooting can only contain non - recommended value.
•Lemma 8 . Because i t depends only on sets valuesri trouble - free  processes, this proof  is still correct. Lemma 14 . The algorithm described in Figure 3 ensures that each non - fault decision process.
Prove that we f i rst observed, due to the expiration of the t imer always, " wait"
statements ( revised l ine M- 05 and M 07 ) always terminates, so Lemma 9 is still correct. Readers can also check the proof of Lemma 10 is still valid.
It still indicates that there has rounded R at  the f inal end, which all non - fault handling  Pi w have the same value in their set of variables ( valuesri = { W}) ( from which decides Since Lemma 10 ) demonstrated shown that, due to the assumed f inal synchronization ( a) in, ( b)
the wheel coordination mechanism, and ( c) of the message by the wheel
Coordinator transmission COORD_ VALUE, there is a circle R, as valuesri = { w} of each process in the non- defective.
Let us consider a t ime t ( arrive in t ime - out value of all non- fault process, so that all information exchanged by the non - faulty process) from ( due to the lemma 12 )
synchronization system behavior. Let r PK is coordinated by the process does not  fail after t  min of  the number of  turns. The circular R, PK broadcast COORD_ VALUE [ R] l ine NEW 2  ( W),   a f i rst value is set into i ts watt bin_ valuesk [ R] is. Message COORD_ VALUE [ R] ( w) is
received by all non- faulty process in a t imely manner, to  the set { w} AUXI l ine NEW 4 .  Thus, all non- fault handling broadcast AUX in the M - 06 l ine of [ R] ({ W}) and t he l ine receiving
M-077 in the ( N - t) of the AUX [ R] ({ W}) from a different process message, the l ine is set to

Naming system:

The traditional use of the Internet Domain Nam e System ( DNS) maps humanreadable names to IP addresses ( which gives the location of the nodes and content). When Internet
users type in their browser, DNS server returns a human - readable names to IP addresses in cnn. com. ICANN, a non - profit organization, management and DNS root servers. The server
is the central point of trust and failure; they can be taken offline by DDo S attacks and
change the DNS server domain mapping through coercion, deception or change from their

responses.
In pointnity, we need to replace the dispersion DNS i . e., binds human - readable name to discover data, but without any central point of failure or control system. There is
thought that human- readable name is not important, long ID and password of search engine combining alternative DNS - school. Our view is that human- readable names is to provide a good user experience, and essential in practice, i t  would be  hard to  convince Internet users  to change their habits, and stop using the online human - readable name.
No basic computer science challenges and build a naming system. There are three attributes, we may need to have a name: The name is
(1)) The only ( meaning that the absence of two  independent  people  can  create  and use unique names l ike cnn. com)
(2)) a human- readable
(3)) Dispersion ( name should be selected by the user in the center at the edge of the network by the central authorities, rather than on behalf of the user). Computer science challenge i s before blockchains, naming system only allows three characteristics [ 15 ] , any
two of the three never at the same t ime. This l imit is  called the triangle Zooko. For example,  the public key is unique, decentralized because users can generate their own computers
without any central service, but not human readable. Twitter handle is human read able, unique, rather than scattered ( Twitter, the company controls namespace). A nickname is human readable and dispersed ( the user can select anyone nickname), but not the only. Blockchains party Zooko triangle, and for the f i rst t ime there may be no use of a unique human- readable name of any centralized services.
Namecoin is the f i rst system to use blockchain establish decentralized naming system.
